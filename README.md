# üõ°Ô∏è Project Name: ShadowMesh
> A decentralized, end-to-end encrypted, privacy-first communication platform that runs without centralized servers, user data collection, or app store distribution.

## üö® DISCLAIMER
This project is **NOT** for profit, commercial use, or public distribution via Google Play or App Store. This is a **community-driven, open-source privacy contribution**, encouraging users to build and host the app themselves. Use it responsibly and understand that **once access is lost, there is no recovery.**

---

## üß† Philosophy

ShadowMesh is built with the following **privacy-first principles**:

1. **Zero Trust Model** ‚Äî not even the developer can access user data.
2. **No Data Recovery** ‚Äî user anonymity is preserved through irreversible identity design.
3. **No Central Hosting** ‚Äî users host their own backend servers at home.
4. **No App Store** ‚Äî users must build and install the app themselves.
5. **No Logs / No IP Trace** ‚Äî complete anonymity, even if a node is compromised.
6. **Self-Destruct Option** ‚Äî emergency kill-switch erases all traces locally.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

### 1. **Client-Side (Mobile App - React Native or Flutter)**
- Contains UI, messaging logic, encryption engine.
- Connects to user‚Äôs own backend relay (via `.onion` or LAN IP).
- Does **not** know public IP or location of any other user.
- Stores identity in **volatile memory** unless persistent mode is enabled.

### 2. **Home Relay Server**
- Open-source Node.js or Rust-based relay software.
- Runs behind a Tor Hidden Service.
- Passes messages only, no storage or logs.
- Accessible via `.onion` address only.

### 3. **Communication Flow**
- User A App --> Tor --> User B‚Äôs Home Server (via Onion) --> User B App
- Entire traffic is onion-routed.
- Messages are encrypted with recipient‚Äôs public key.
- No IPs are ever exposed.

## üîê Security Design

### **Feature	Description**
- Identity	Random UUID or Ed25519 keypair (no username/email)
- Session Storage	Local secure storage (no sync or backup)
- Transport	Encrypted via TLS + Tor Layer
- Message Security	NaCl box (Curve25519 + XSalsa20 + Poly1305)
- Metadata Removal	No IPs, no timestamps, no user agent, no headers
- Compromise Plan	Kill-switch wipes RAM + local secure store

---

## üî• Kill Switch

### **The app includes an emergency kill-switch that:**

- Immediately erases:
- - Identity keys
- - Local storage (chats, tokens)
- - Session info
- Secure deletes using platform tools (shred, rm -P, wipe, etc.)
- Overwrites in-memory values with zeroes before shutdown
- Activation Options:
- - Manual button (long press)
- - Codeword or signal received in message
- - Inactivity timeout (optional)

---

## üß∞ Requirements

### **Client**
- React Native / Flutter
- Tor Proxy (e.g., Orbot)
- NaCl or Libsodium library
- Secure storage (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore)

### **Server**
- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) or Raspberry Pi
- Tor installed and running hidden service
- Node.js or Rust for relay server
- Firewall blocking everything except Tor

---

## üîß Setup Instructions

### **1. Clone the Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/shadowmesh.git
cd shadowmesh
```

### **2. Configure Tor Hidden Service**
- Edit your torrc:
```swift
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/shadowmesh/
HiddenServicePort 8080 127.0.0.1:8080
```

- Restart Tor:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart tor
```

- Find your .onion domain:
```bash
cat /var/lib/tor/shadowmesh/hostname
```

### **3. Run the Server**
```bash
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```

### **4. Build the App (Manual Only)**
- No pre-built APKs or IPAs provided.
```bash
cd client
npm install
npx expo run:android
# or
npx react-native run-android
```

---

## üö´ No IP Trace Policy
- All connections go through Tor .onion addresses.
- No IP is ever stored, even in memory.
- Traffic between clients and servers is fully encrypted and anonymous.
- App refuses to operate if VPN/Tor is not active (configurable).

## üïµÔ∏è FAQ

### **Q: What if I lose my device or data?**
- You cannot recover it. That‚Äôs the point. No one‚Äînot even the developer‚Äîcan help you.

### **Q: Can governments or hackers track me?**
- Not if you follow proper opsec. Use Tor, avoid revealing your identity, and always run the kill-switch if you're at risk.

### **Q: Can someone build a fake version with backdoors?**
- Yes. That‚Äôs why this project must be self-built and audited by the user. No third-party builds are trusted.
